- 👋 Hi, I’m Julia Manoilo✨
- 👀 "I’m interested in the history of our planet and its development over time, especially the evolution of life and major geological events."🦕🦖
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, focusing on understanding the basics like variables, data types, loops, and functions. My goal is to eventually build projects, such as simple web applications or data analysis tools, as I deepen my knowledge of libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Flask.
- 💞️I’m looking to collaborate on Python projects to gain hands-on experience, improve my coding skills, and learn best practices in software development. I'm especially interested in working on projects involving data analysis, web development, or automation scripts.
